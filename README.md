In all honesty, I already coded this project in javascript locally on my computer (to which, this is the tic tac toe project from The Odin Project). I didn't code it fully (DOM is disconnected from the script itself), so there is still time to make additional commits. The instructions from The Odin Project's outline made this a lot more difficult. Firstly, I had to get a working game in the console (which was harder) without global code (easier) and without working on HTML and CSS (significantly harder. I made a separate codebase where the HTML and DOM were included initially and--if coding without HTML and CSS took me 3 days--having the HTML and DOM in order before working with javascript made the process last 2 hours MAXIMUM!). Now, I'm making a repository because I'm sure of the direction of where this project is going (and I honestly needed a version control system); however, I find the best way for me to figure out the scripting of it all is to... just code.

As I said, the project isn't finished, but it nearly is. So, I hope you thoroughly enjoy the finished result!
